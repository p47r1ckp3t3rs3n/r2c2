In case you are facing this error, it means you need to install Python's `requests` module. You can install it by running the command:
```
pip3 install requests
```
If the above command triggers an environment related error, you can install `requests` via a virtual environment. Follow the steps below.

1. First, create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
2. Then, install `requests`:
```
pip install requests
```
3. Lastly, deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```
